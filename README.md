# Python Decorators Tutorial

Welcome to the **Python Decorator Tutorial** repository! This guide is designed to help you understand and master Python decorators, one of the most elegant and powerful features in the language.

## What are Python Decorators?
Python decorators allow you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions and methods without altering their code. They provide a flexible and elegant way to add extra functionality to existing functions, such as:

- **Logging**
- **Authentication**
- **Timing functions**
- **Memoization**

If youâ€™ve ever wondered how Python achieves such seamless functionality, decorators are often at the heart of the answer.



## About the Blog Post

  Python decorators are powerful tools that allow you to enhance or modify the behavior of functions and methods dynamically. This repository includes:
